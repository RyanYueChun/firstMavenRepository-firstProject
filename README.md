# firstMavenRepository-firstProject
This first project is here only to be added as a dependency to the "second-app" project.

When this first project is built its .jar file will be locally available in :
    ~/.m2/repository/com/mycompany/app/my-app/1.0-SNAPSHOT/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

From here any other projects locally found on your local machine will be able to make use of it if this "my-app" is one of their dependencies.
